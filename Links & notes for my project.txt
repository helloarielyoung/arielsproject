Google Maps
    API key:  AIzaSyAQebJTWGOQmOsuTYscQ5bjCVjBenHOgC0 

Mapbox
    driving directions
        example: https://www.mapbox.com/mapbox-gl-js/example/mapbox-gl-directions/

        Maybe v4 returns the actual data?
        https://www.mapbox.com/api-documentation/pages/directions-v4.html

    point animation
        example: https://www.mapbox.com/mapbox-gl-js/example/animate-point-along-route/

    turf
        https://www.mapbox.com/help/analysis-with-turf/


        line-distance:
            example: https://www.mapbox.com/mapbox-gl-js/example/measure/
            documentation:  https://github.com/turf-junkyard/turf-line-distance

        turf.along:
            docs:  http://turfjs.org/docs/ and search for "along"

            turf.along looks like it has feature "Center" that I can use in future release to calculate the center point between User1 and User2... and then use Yelp to find a restaurant near that center point...



working with routes data from mapbox
    bash command line:
         curl "https://api.mapbox.com/directions/v5/mapbox/driving/-122.4114, 37.7887;-122.4683, 37.7181?steps=true&alternatives=true&access_token=sk.eyJ1IjoiaGVsbG9hcmllbCIsImEiOiJjajJhbTF2MmEwMDhnMzNvZzhndDZkOG5oIn0.M8t-MQ_OSc_hCGwSDkyjnQ" > directions.json
         (found this here:  https://www.mapbox.com/api-documentation/#directions)

    interactive python:
        f=open('directions.json')
        data = f.read()

        import json
        data = json.loads(data)

        new_data = data['routes'][0]['legs'][0]['steps']

        directions = []

        for step in new_data:
            directions.append(step['intersections'][0]['location'])


    Polyline
        installed polyline:   npm install @mapbox/polyline
        but still did not get polyline to work.
