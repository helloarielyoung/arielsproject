**_Rendezvous_** is a fullstack web application designed for coordinating meeting with your friends and knowing their estimated time of arrival and any traffic delays encountered along their way to your rendezvous.  As users create new invitations, Google Places Autocomplete makes suggestions based on their input.  Users select the destination, set a date and time, and invite their friends to meet them.  As each person on the invitation gets ready to go, they select a Google Maps Route, and their progress toward the rendezvous is shared with the other users.  Google Maps traffic alerts received by one users are shared with the other users, and as each person arrives at the rendezvous the others are notified.

#### Technologies
Python, Flask, PostgreSQL, SQLAlchemy, HTML/CSS, Twitter Bootstrap, JavaScript, jQuery,  AJAX, Google Maps API, Google Places Web Service

#### Version 2.0

#### Make it Mobile
Obviously, this app needs to work on your phone, so my first updates to the app will be to improve the responsiveness as the device size goes down so it works well on a mobile device.

#### Facebook Friends
I would like to use OAuth to incorporate the Facebook API so users can invite their Facebook friends rather than having access only to people who have directly signed up with Rendezvous.

#### Modifications to Invitations
I plan to add a feature that lets users modify the location, date and/or time of the Rendezvous.

#### Suggest Alternatives
In a future version, I plan to add a feature that allows the recipient of a Rendezvous invitation to respond back with an alternative place, date, or time which the creator of the invitation could accept or decline.

#### Email Notifications
I plan to incorporate email notifications (with settings options to opt-out) when new invitations are received, responses are received to invitations you have sent, reminders of upcoming Rendezvous, and notification when Rendezvous details change.
