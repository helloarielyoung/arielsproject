Working with unicode:
  omg, cleanest way to convert from unicode:
  import ast
  new_thing = ast.literal_eval(your_unicode_string)

  and new_thing will BE whatever your unicode string looked like.  in my case, it looked like a string, and after ast.literal_eval, it IS a string.

Google Maps Map
  Signed up for Google Maps JavaScript API
  Saved key to secrets.sh
  Must run "source secrets.sh" in bash to load up the key to environment variable
  Key is then available in server.py using "import os" and setting value to varible, which I pass to the app_route that needs to access map API,
  and then use jinja to stick that variable in the path that is passed:
        <script
    src="https://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/js?key={{ map_api_key }}&callback=initMap">
        </script>

Trouble with "AssertionError: Popped wrong request context.  (None instead of <RequestContext 'http://localhost/' [GET] of server>)"
  Did not fix it:  adding to setup - app.config['PRESERVE_CONTEXT_ON_EXCEPTION'] = False
  FIXED:  had the POST within the context of "with c.session_transaction() as sess:",
    which was not a valid context...  it let the post work (the login happened and
    the redirect happened!) but when it poped out to the rest of the test, it
    had the wrong context and threw that error.

Trouble with sqlalchemy/jinja:
              {% if user.invites.status == 'act' %} 
  UndefinedError: 'sqlalchemy.orm.collections.InstrumentedList object' has no attribute 'status'

Passing data from html to javascript.
  Way I didn't do it that may work better than the way i did it:
    <!-- makes data-login attribute, which can be read in JS as $('#map').data('login')-->
    <script type="text/javascript">
      $('#map').data( 'login', {{ session.login }})

Things that were not working for AJAX call to get invitation waypoints data:
        
        Attempt #1:
        success: function(data) {
          // do stuf with the query data that is returned
            alert="ajax call did something!"
          },
          error: function(xhr) {
          alert="there was an error retrieving waypoint data!"
          }
        });

        function DecideWhichUser(user_id, invite_id, queries) {
          
        }

        Attempt #2 (I think the $.post stuff is right, but not sure how to actually
            use this)  ARG!:
        function() {
          $.post('/map-data.json',
          {
            invite_id = {{ invite_id }}
          },
          function(data, status){
            alert("Data: " + data + "\nStatus: " + status);
          });
        }

        Ideas to try:
            $( window ).on( "load", function() { ... })
            $( document ).ready(function() {}

Things that I did to get Path formatted correctly:
  NOTE:  to draw the polyline of route:
  path = needs to be formated as: 
    [{'lat': 37.748915, 'lng': -122.4181515}, {'lat': 37.7482293, 'lng': -122.4182139}...] 


// what it looks like when you enter it manually (and it works):
 //  path: [{'lat': 37.748915, 'lng': -122.4181515},
 // {'lat': 37.7482293, 'lng': -122.4182139},
 // {'lat': 37.7496136, 'lng': -122.4041771}],

    in server.py:
        user1path = []

        user1query = db.session.query(Waypoint.waypoint_lat,
                                      Waypoint.waypoint_long).filter(Waypoint.user_id == 1,
                                                                    Waypoint.invite_id == 1).all()

        for waypoint in user1query:
            waypoint_dict = {}
            waypoint_dict['lat'] = float(waypoint[0])
            waypoint_dict['lng'] = float(waypoint[1])
            user1path.append(waypoint_dict)
    but when user1path was interpreted by jinja (in {{ user1path }} ) it was putting
        the symbols for the single quotes around lat & lng instead of literal single quotes

    so tried in the HTML:
        tried this:
           // but it was putting code instead of single quote round 'lat'
          path: {{ user1path }},

        tried this:
         path: [
          {% for waypoint in user1query: %}
            {'lat': waypoint[0], 'lng': waypoint[1]},
          {% endfor %}
          ],

***Fixed** I was so close.  Fixed by putting jinja {{}} around wayoint[0] and waypoint[1]
      POSSIBLE ALTERNATIVE if this gets funky (since jinja within Javascript can
        go south:  create a separate route that returns json with just the route
        data and pass that back to the javascript as a separate thing.

            turf.along looks like it has feature "Center" that I can use in future release to calculate the center point between User1 and User2... and then use Yelp to find a restaurant near that center point...



working with routes data from mapbox

    Polyline
        installed polyline:   npm install @mapbox/polyline
        but still did not get polyline to work.
