***TO DO***
***********

Make Friends table(s?) in model.py
Make Manage Friends route & page
    add friends if you know their email address & it exists in User
    Email friends to invite them to join Rendezvous
Get better route data for user1 and user2 and put it in seed.py
Improve Login
    add some javascript to check for valid data w/out reloading page
How about some login security?!
    Do not display password when typing
    Do some encryption or something of password?
        No idea... what if i grab Bootstrap logins, will all this
        be done for me?
      place to start research?:
        for the password hash for user login i used import hashlib salt = 'something' hash = hashlib.md5(salt + pword).hexdigest()
Design queries that will be used by app
    Test those queries
Add tests
Add marker on destination point
Add link on map to get back to Rendezvous pages?
How can I supress the link to Homepage from the homepage, but have it everywhere else?
Change color of User1/User2's routes
Allow two users to see the same map
    Color code "my" route vs "other" route
    Maybe add a tag to the animation with their name all tiny
Send alert to "other" user when one user arrives at destination
Add tests!
Display ETA of "other" user
If traffic alert rec'd by one user, display that to other user
Modify everything to allow n-users on an invitation (for loops!)
    map display each route animation in different color/tag with name
    map display "my" route in distinct color
Make Invitation route & form for creating new invitation
    Google Maps autofill to choose destination
    (later - Or select from a map?)
    Checkboxes to choose Friends to invite
    Date/time of Rendezvous
Make User landing page for after login
    Shows "current" Invitations
Forgot User Name & Forgot Password stuff
Make Invitation management route & page
    Accept or Decline invitation(s)
    Modify invitation (by user who created it)
    Propose alternatives (by invited users)
    Includes "Go" button which (idealy):
        opens Google Maps w/destination from Invitation populated
        prompts you with suggested routes
        lets you choose a route
        makes your chosen route information available to other user(2) on invitation
    Includes a "Stop" button which turns off route sharing
Expire Invitations when all users have arrived at destination
Obtain geolocation info and update animation of routes & status info in real time
Email Invitation announcement to invited users
Email reminders of Rendezvous at set intervals
    Make Settings route & page for user to manage settings
        email notification of Invitation
        reminder frequency
Handle timezone differences between users


Way Future Features:
    For Rendezvous happening in x-minutes, when setting up invitation show other mutual friends that are nearby to prompt you to invite them (given permission from users to "share location for invites") ?? Can this even be done?? query geolocation of someone not logged in? probably not?
    Be able to put in date/time of rendezvous and your departure location & method of travel and friend's likely departure location & method of travel & have it suggest places that are halfway between you not as the crow flies, but by how long it's going to take each of you to arrive.
