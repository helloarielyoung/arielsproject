Way Future Features:
    For Rendezvous happening in x-minutes, when setting up invitation show other mutual friends that are nearby to prompt you to invite them (given permission from users to "share location for invites") ?? Can this even be done?? query geolocation of someone not logged in? probably not?
    Be able to put in date/time of rendezvous and your departure location & method of travel and friend's likely departure location & method of travel & have it suggest places that are halfway between you not as the crow flies, but by how long it's going to take each of you to arrive.
